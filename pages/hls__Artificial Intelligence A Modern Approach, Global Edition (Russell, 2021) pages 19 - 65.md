		- For thousands of years, we have tried to understand *how we think and act*—that is, how our brain, a mere handful of matter, can perceive, understand, predict, and manipulate a world far larger and more complicated than itself

		- Whereas a student of an older science such as physics might feel that the best ideas have already been discovered by Galileo, Newton, Curie, Einstein, and the rest, AI still has many openings for full-time masterminds.

	- AI currently encompasses a huge variety of subﬁelds, ranging from the general (learning, reasoning, perception, and so on) to the speciﬁc, such as playing chess, proving mathematical theorems, writing poetry, driving a car, or diagnosing diseases. AI is relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal ﬁeld.

		- Historically, researchers have pursued several different versions of AI. Some have deﬁned intelligence in terms of ﬁdelity to human performance, while others prefer an abstract, formal deﬁnition of intelligence called:

		- **rationality**—loosely speaking, doing the “right thing.” The subject matter Rationality itself also varies: some consider intelligence to be a property of internal thought processes and reasoning, while others focus on intelligent behavior, an external characterization.[^1]

			  [^1]:In the public eye, there is sometimes confusion between the terms “artiﬁcial intelligence” and “machine learning.” Machine learning is a subﬁeld of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience. Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.
	- From these two dimensions—human vs. rational[^2] and thought vs. behavior—there are four possible combinations, and there have been adherents and research programs for all four.

		- The methods used are necessarily different: the pursuit of human-like intelligence must be in part an empirical science related to psychology, involving observations and hypotheses about actual human behavior and thought processes; a rationalist approach, on the other hand, involves a combination of mathematics and engineering, and connects to statistics, control theory, and economics.

		  [^2]:We are not suggesting that humans are “irrational” in the dictionary sense of “deprived of normal mental clarity.” We are merely conceding that human decisions are not always mathematically perfect.

		- A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer. Chapter 28 discusses the details of the test and whether a computer would really be intelligent if it passed.
