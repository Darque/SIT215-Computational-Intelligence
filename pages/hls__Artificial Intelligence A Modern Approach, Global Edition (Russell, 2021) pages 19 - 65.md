AI is relevant to any intellectual task; it is truly a universal ﬁeld.

			  [^1]:In the public eye, there is sometimes confusion between the terms “artiﬁcial intelligence” and “machine learning.” Machine learning is a subﬁeld of AI that studies the ability to improve performance based on experience. Some AI systems use machine learning methods to achieve competence, but some do not.

		- The methods used are necessarily different: the pursuit of human-like intelligence must be in part an empirical science related to psychology, involving observations and hypotheses about actual human behavior and thought processes; a rationalist approach, on the other hand, involves a combination of mathematics and engineering, and connects to statistics, control theory, and economics.

			- ==_However it does create duplicitous answers that lack a cohesive outcome, it is therefore fractuous. This lack of directionality and discipline towards a perceived goal, reduces certainty of action that is core to having agency. A rational agent is by definition, not an agent, but constructs the environment of potentiality. The agent must collapse the possible into the certainty of outcome based on the desirable objective. Agent as defined here exposes the agent of Chaos as it fails to act and therefore fails to exclude an infinitely large scope of undesirable outcome._==
		- We can often work back from this speciﬁcation to derive agent designs that provably achieve it—something that is largely impossible if the goal is to imitate human behavior or thought processes.

		- In the early decades, rational agents were built on logical foundations and formed deﬁnite plans to achieve speciﬁc goals.

		- __In a nutshell, AI has focused on the study and construction of agents that *do the right thing*__. What counts as the right thing is deﬁned by the objective that we provide to the agent.

		- This general paradigm is so pervasive that we might call it the **standard model.** It prevails not only in AI, but also in control theory, where a controller minimizes a cost function; in operations research, where a policy maximizes a sum of rewards; in statistics, where a decision rule minimizes a loss function; and in economics, where a decision maker maximizes utility or some measure of social welfare.

- We need to make one important reﬁnement to the standard model to account for the fact that perfect rationality—always taking the exactly optimal action—is not feasible in complex environments.
